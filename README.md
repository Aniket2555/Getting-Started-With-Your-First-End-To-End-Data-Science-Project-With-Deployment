## Python Libraries and Their Roles

| Library | Role / Purpose |
|:--------|:----------------|
| **pandas** | Data analysis and manipulation tool; great for handling structured data (tables, CSVs, DataFrames). |
| **mlflow** | Platform to manage the full machine learning lifecycle: tracking experiments, packaging code, sharing models. |
| **notebook** | Provides Jupyter Notebook interface for running Python code interactively in the browser. |
| **numpy** | Core library for numerical computations; supports arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions. |
| **scikit-learn** | Machine learning library offering algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, etc. |
| **matplotlib** | Library for creating static, animated, and interactive plots and visualizations. |
| **python-box** | Makes dictionaries easier to use by allowing dot notation access (`box.key` instead of `box['key']`). |
| **pyyaml** | Parse and produce YAML (human-readable configuration file format) easily in Python. |
| **tqdm** | Progress bar library to show the progress of loops or function execution — very handy for long-running tasks. |
| **ensure** | Small library for easy assertions and conditions. Useful for defensive programming. |
| **joblib** | For saving and loading Python objects efficiently; often used for model persistence (saving scikit-learn models). |
| **types-PyYAML** | Type stubs for `pyyaml` — helps with type checking and autocompletion in editors, but not needed at runtime. |
| **Flask** | Lightweight web framework for building web applications and REST APIs. |
| **Flask-Cors** | Flask extension for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), allowing your Flask APIs to be accessible from different domains. |
